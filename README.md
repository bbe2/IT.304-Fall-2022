**Course Description**    
Systems analysis and design is an art form, discipline, and science. The 1890s witnessed rooting pillars of speed, quality, and control checks. Frederick Taylor normalized stopwatches, checklists, and similar rooting metric tracking and control.

To perform systems analysis and design well, it helps to understand different models. Then what operation managers need to see, what business leaders want to achieve, and what financiers insist on for sustainability. Information technology (IT) facilitates systems analysis by codifying everything. And, Artificial intelligence (AI) identifies untapped potential by pairing unseen connections with supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning.  
 
In the 1990s, MIT computer science professor Michael Hammer developed the management theory of business process re-engineering (BPS). Its tenets are process improvement, process re-design, and process re-engineering. BPS emphasizes the application of a holistic view of understanding how business objectives and processes are, or are not, actually aligned.  
 
Question: have you stood in line in a coffee shop while the servers are busy doing lots of things but not helping you? IT online ordering has changed business operations, and some may point out that customers are not first in this mixed business model. Online orders get prioritized over in-person, but how would BPS look at such inventory first in, first out policies?  
 
In the 2020s, BPS is alive and well, as witnessed by consultancies like IBM’s Business Process Reengineering <IBM-BPRS> and Bain & Company’s Business Process Redesign <Bain>. BPS names change, such as Accenture’s Human + machine intelligence, but its principles and focus remain profitable.
