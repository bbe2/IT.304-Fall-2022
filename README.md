Course Description
Systems analysis and design is an art form, discipline, and science, and it has a deep history dating back to the 1890s, forming the salient pillars of speed, quality, and control.

To perform systems analysis and design it helps to understand different models, what operation managers need to see happening, what business leaders want to achieve, and what financiers insist as necessary to ensure an ongoing concern.

In the 1990s, MIT computer science professor Michael Hammer developed the management theory of business process re-engineering (BPS) focused on process improvement, process re-design, and process re-engineering, emphasizing a holistic focus on business objectives and how processes relate to them. The theoretical work still has legs today, as witnessed by IBM’s Business Process Reengineering <IBM-BPRS> and Bain & Company’s Business Process Redesign <Bain>. Names change, such as Accenture’s Human + machine intelligence, but systems analysis and design principles are fundamental. 

Business requirements, business rules, system specifications, environmental factors, technology (personal and corporate), people, skills, and methods change. Such change provides opportunities to tear things apart, reorganize, recodify, and demonstrate to business constituents and customers the right effort to maintain viability.


Skill achievement in this arena derives from selecting models to frame systems and applying them to business process engineering swim lanes, IDEF0, object models, and others as detailed. Competency is determined based on the quality of system abstraction necessary to institute meaningful change. Students will be able to focus on models that work MOST interest and are meaningful to their future goals. 

This course will develop skills to perform systems analysis and design as evidenced by:
1.	Written examination and diagnostics of systems thinking.
2.	Use of information modeling to draft system requirements.
3.	Use of data and object model programming to codify information systems.

Tools and technologies to facilitate evidence formation include,
1.	Document and spreadsheet software such as MS Word \ MS-Excel.
2.	Microsoft Visio (required).
3.	Apply systems analysis and design principles by translating business and information structures into object models, systems requirement specifications, and.or implementation plans.
4.	Case studies.

Course competencies:
•	IT-20358: Make ethically informed decisions based on awareness of legal and organization parameters
•	IT-20359: Develop a systems requirements specification
•	IT-30360: Develop an implementation plan

Required textbooks:
Resources are critical to success in this course, and information is gathered from various sources to minimize personal learning costs. Towards this end, the instructor provides online references to the extent possible and only recommends materials with constant learning value. When applicable, consider acquiring materials from the SNHU Online Bookstore.

The following textbook is well suited for class purposes. Class.1 and Class.2 will guide a course of action for purchase or rental of Scott Tilley book.

Tools and technologies to facilitate evidence:
1.	Document and spreadsheet software such as MS Word \ MS-Excel.
2.	Microsoft Visio.
1.	Visio is required unless there is strong evidence for similar software discussed with the instructor. Translation ability to Adobe pdf required.
2.	At a minimum, any other software must be able to generate Adobe pdf.
3.	Case studies (provided weekly).
4.	Topic discussion and question and answer (Q&A) blogs via slack, blackboard, or a student recommended, and class agreed on preference.

Required software:
•	Document and spreadsheet processing software.
•	Microsoft VISIO (available through university here)
•	Python
o	Best place to start = jupyter notebook classic home
o	Jupyter :: Anaconda.org

Instructor availability and response time
•	Interaction with the instructor and classmates will occur regularly on Wednesdays and Fridays at 11:00 in room 209 SETA building. 
•	The instructor can be available before and after class from 8 AM till approximately 3 PM for in person discussion. Please request a day ahead. 
•	Communications will typically occur during class for the benefit of everyone. If the class agrees can record lectures as a video backup.
•	The class will use either slack or blackboard for discussion blogging.
•	Please feel free to communicate with your instructor via b.hogan@snhu.edu at any time and for any topic. 
•	Grades and feedback are within seven days of a submitted assignment. 

Grading Guides
Specific activity directions, grading guides, posting requirements, and additional deadlines are provided in assignment information.


Weekly Assignment Schedule
Reading assignments, activities, and tasks are distributed during the first class each week on Wed except for the first week. Please reach out to the instructor for students interested in doing work ahead of schedule.

The coursework is challenging, accessible, and extremely useful. As such, the expectation is that work progresses naturally in an ongoing fashion with self-interest and self-motivation guiding your participation and creativity of desired outcomes.

Assignments are due the day they are due per the world’s clock. If it is still December 31st “somewhere,” your work is not late.

Select a process you love or dislike. Define its input, outputs, resources, and constraints (IORC). Logically what goes into the system is either consumed or comes out. Notate ALL you think of. Then, list 5 to 10 high-level activities performed by the IORC. Use paper and pencil and send me a picture anytime end of the day tomorrow. I am only asking for a max of 15 min to whip up. Please spend more if having fun. Thank you for considering this fast turnaround, as I will use all work submitted to start Friday's lecture. Perform work as a team as desired or convenient.
