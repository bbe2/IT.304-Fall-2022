**Course Description**
Systems analysis and design is an art form, discipline, and science. The 1890s witnessed the formative pillars of speed, quality, and checklists thanks to the efforts of Frederick Taylor. HHis methods, and his stop-watches, are still in use^.

To perform systems analysis and design well, it helps to understand different process models alongside what operation managers need to see, what business leaders want to achieve, and what financiers insist on for sustainability. Information technology (IT) facilitates systems design efforts through codification. And now Artificial intelligence (AI) identifies gaps and untapped potential y pairing unseen connections through deep learning.  
 
In the 1990s, MIT computer science professor Michael Hammer developed the management theory of business process re-engineering (BPS). Its tenets are process improvement, process re-design, and process re-engineering. BPS emphasizes the application of a holistic view of understanding how business  objectives and processes are, or are not, actually aligned.  
 
Question: have you stood in line in a coffee shop while the servers are busy doing lots of things but not helping you? IT online ordering has changed business operations and perhaps customer experience is not out of alignment with the new transaction processing model. Good design principals can help alleviate the potential of such unforeseen consequences.  
 
In the 2020s, BPS is alive and well, as witnessed by consultancies like IBM’s Business Process Reengineering <IBM-BPRS> and Bain & Company’s Business Process Redesign <Bain>. BPS names change, such as Accenture’s Human + machine intelligence, but its principles and focus remain profitable.
