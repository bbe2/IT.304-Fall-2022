Course Description
Systems analysis and design is an art form, discipline, and science, and it has a deep history dating back to the 1890s, forming the salient pillars of speed, quality, and control.

To perform systems analysis and design, it helps to understand different models, what operation managers need to see, what business leaders want to achieve, and what financiers insist on for sustainability. Information technology (IT) databases are the facilitators of systems analysis codifying everything, and artificial intelligence (AI) helps realize unknown potentiality never achieved by Fordism, IDS, and TQM.
 
In the 1990s, MIT computer science professor Michael Hammer developed the management theory of business process re-engineering (BPS) focused on process improvement, process re-design, and process re-engineering. Tenets of BPS emphasized applying a holistic point of view toward business objectives and how, in reality, the business process does or does not align with them. The theoretical work is today witnessed by consultancies like IBM’s Business Process Reengineering <IBM-BPRS> and Bain & Company’s Business Process Redesign <Bain>. BPS names change, such as Accenture’s Human + machine intelligence, but BPS analysis of systems principles is constant.
 
Business requirements, business rules, system specifications, environmental factors, technology (personal and corporate), people, skills, and methods change. Change provides opportunities to tear things apart, reorganize, recodify, and demonstrate new or improved viability to constituents. IT is critical to this process, and learning how to apply BPS models will distinguish you from your peers and, more importantly, help you become a better systems designer through abstraction and looking ahead skilling.
Skill achievement in this arena derives from selecting models to frame systems with BPS models and using process engineering competencies to abstract systems and institute quality engineered solutions. It can also be difficult to measure overall competency, other than the stock price, because people are the systems change so if two designers leave, work can be shelved or implemented haphazardly. 
 
Students are encouraged to focus learning on what is MOST meaningful to their future goals.
