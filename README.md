**Course Description**  
Systems analysis and design is an artform, discipline, and science. Thanks to Frederick Taylor, the 1890s embedded the formative pillars of speed, quality, and checklists. Taylorist principals remain essential in all system efforts [1].  

To perform systems analysis and design well, it helps to know different reengineering models, the language of operation managers, what business leaders want to achieve, and critical impediments to sustainability. Information technology (IT) facilitates systems design efforts by codifying information. Today, Artificial intelligence (AI) helps drive system work by identifying unseen connections with tools like deep learning neural networks.  
 
In the 1990s, MIT computer science professor Michael Hammer developed the management theory of business process re-engineering (BPS). Its tenets are process improvement, process re-design, and process re-engineering. BPS emphasizes the application of a holistic view to assessing how business objectives and processes are or are not aligned.  

Question: have you stood in line in a coffee shop while the servers are busy doing lots of things but not helping you? IT online ordering has changed business operations, and perhaps customer experience is out of alignment with new transaction processing models. The learning is, quality system design principals would have identified this inconvenience a priori versus implementing a poor customer design.  

In the 2020s, BPS is alive and well, as witnessed by consultancies like IBM’s Business Process Reengineering <IBM-BPRS> and Bain & Company’s Business Process Redesign <Bain>. BPS names change, such as Accenture’s Human + machine intelligence, but its Tayloristic principles remain exceedingly profitable.
